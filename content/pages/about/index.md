	I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;50&nbsp;something techie living in either "Atlanta" or Woodstock, GA &mdash; depending on who's asking. I have a passion for listening to live music, especially when it's performed in a small venue in front of an enthusiastic crowd of patrons. I enjoy lots of different genres but I'm particularly fond of Americana and singer/songwriter types. I try to support local artists at every oppportunity, and I'm a firm believer that great new music is still being made; you just won't find it on your radio.</p>
